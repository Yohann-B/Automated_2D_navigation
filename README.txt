*------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

This is a matlab project realized in education purposes.

#To run the map creation:

	- Launch matlab and open the file "mapping.m".
 	- Run the code.
 	- It displays the potential field of generated by the environment 
	  you configured.
 
#To run the simulation:

 	- Launch matlab and open the file "solver.m".
 	- Run the code.
 	- It displays both the computed positions of the robot on the space 
	  over the time and the trajectory of the robot on the potential 
	  field.

#Files overview:
	"Report_AN.pdf"
This pdf file contain the report of the project that defines the problem's setup
and gives explanations about the procedure. The results are also displayed and
lightly discussed.

	"mapping.m"
This file is a script that generates a potential field regarding the environment. 
It needs the user to configure several things as the elements's position and 
weight, the size of the map... Running it displays the potential field in 3D 
plot and in topological plot. The same algorithm is later used for simulation.

	"solver.m"
This file is a script that simulates the trajctory of the vehicle in the 
environment. It uses ode23 and the file "robot.m" to solve the dynamics and 
compute the next position of the robot. It also uses "StopSimulation.m".

	"robot.m"
This file is a function used by "solver.m" that contains every calculations 
about the robot. It computes the sum of the forces applied by the elements in 
the environment to compute a steering angle. The proportional controller of the 
robot is giving a comand to the steering wheel regarding this angle. The state
equations of the robot are then defined using those values.

	"StopSimulation.m"
This file is a function which is used as an option in ode23 to stop the
simulation after the vehicle reached the target.
